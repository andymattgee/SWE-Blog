This will serve as basic walk through of folder structure of app:

/client - This directory will contain all your React frontend code. Inside, you might have:
    /src - For your React components, utilities, hooks, and any other JavaScript or JSX files.
    /public - For public assets like images, index.html, etc.
/server - Contains your Express.js server and API logic. 
    /controllers - For functions that directly respond to HTTP requests.
    /models - For your MongoDB models (using Mongoose, perhaps).
    /routes - To define your API endpoints.
.env file -> stores config variables such as PORT, DB connection strings, API keys
webpack.config ->
    -Transpile JSX and ES6+ syntax to browser-compatible JavaScript using Babel.
    -Bundle CSS, possibly processing it through PostCSS (which you'll need for Tailwind CSS).
    -Optimize images and other static assets.
    -Enable hot module replacement (HMR) for a smoother development experience.
package.json - To manage project dependencies and scripts.
    -This project will only utilize a single package.json in root folder for simplicity
